The archer's whole concept is the idea of range advantage. Once they possess the ability to hit without being hit, they can fill any flexible niche: zoning, damage, or crowd control.

archer has 3 subclasses: Sharpshooter, Hunter, and the Hwacha.


Sharpshooter:
Sharp shooters are exactly what they sound like. Firing one powerful shot after another at extreme range, the sharp shooter can see critical points on their opponent and hit those for bonuses. In turn, the sharpshooter cannot cancel their reload or move during the animation.
It has 2 specializations: Sniper and Quickshot.

Snipers sacrifice mobility and constant presence for threat and high damage.
Quickshots use their fast fire rate and legion to apply swathes of statuses to their opponents.

Hunter:
Hunters are a class that creates their own range and weaponizes it. they rely on traps, beasts, and high mobility to launch guerilla warfare. Each one is a general's worst nightmare. The hunter's battle field takes place before the fight, with tactical positioning and deadly presents. On the battle field, the Hunter focuses on protecting the backline, providing supportive fire for the front line, and providing powerful flanks.
There are 3 specializations: Trappers, Tamers, Liner

The Trapper can create more advanced traps which allow them to deal extra damage with their attacks along with the additional damage from the trap itself. This makes any space around them immensely dangerous.
The Liner can attach wires to their arrows, forming complex webs of moving or stationary wire traps that deal damage and apply debuffs.


Hwacha:
Easily the most traditional archer, Hwacha's believe in quantity over quality. Capable of creating giant waves of arrows and constant torrents of bullets, hwacha's must precariously balance dps output with survivability.
It has no specializations, in turn, the Hwacha archer has various bow augments that can be imbued with level points to create a blend of many different forms. The Hwacha bow has 5 primary stats, with 10 levels in each: speed, damage, arrow count, skill damage, and control. Every 5 levels in each stat unlocks a unique skill. Certain combinations of stats will unlock unique skills and abilities.



Gameplay: 

Snipers have access to a "concentration" state where they target a singular opponent. During this state, they can play a minigame that's very much like osu which goes on to the bow's duration stat. It may be canceled at any time. The game gets harder as it goes on. The total point counter at the end increases the critical strike damage and the penetration amount. The cooldown after shooting is far longer though, hitting up to 30 seconds of reload. Snipers have access to muskets and complex bows.
Quickshots can fire and reload semi rapidly. The skill check is from combining different ammunitions to produce a chain reaction. They can load a different magic bullet or arrow into their weapon and the weapons of all their legionaires and use it to launch every one at one or more pressure points on an opponent. While squishy, they certainly pack a punch.

Trappers can use skills and construct traps along the battlefield. These have 4 classifications: fall traps, explosive traps, wire traps, and arrow traps. Each has a different role, whether the hard cc of the fall trap, the high damage of the explosive trap, the slowing effect of the wire trap, or the aoe of the arrow trap. Trappers can disguise the traps to fit terrain but certain types of traps are disguised better on certain kinds of terrain. Your traps can also hit allies, albeit for reduced damage
The Liner can attach line nets to their opponent via arrows, allowing them to wrap a target in wires, inflicting bleed and greatly reducing move speed. They can also use line anchors to create webs of lines, although the preexisting lines affect how the arrows fly. They can grapple to a wall or an opponent, causing the area through which they dashed to be lined with wire lines. On the contrary, all of a liner's lines have a max range and will snap if too far from the liner.

Hwacha's can't precisely aim, but they sure as hell can spew like fuck. The downside? They can't move while shooting, nor when reloading. They truly embody artillary, a one man batallion. They can choose to fire either a torrent of arrows or a multi shot of arrows, and can "prepare" arrows, once they start, they can't stop, not without losing all their prepared arrows that is.
