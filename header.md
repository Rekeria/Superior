Classes:

Classes will be divided into “subclasses” which are specializations.

  

Mage:

Mage is a slow moving class that relies on “focus” and “concentration”. You want glass cannon? You want AOE? YOU WANT MAGE

  
  
  

Archer:

Archer is a class that focuses on range advantage. Whether that be creating range via beasts, abusing huge range by sharp shooting, or using quick tethering to unleash explosive volleys upon your opponent.

  
  

Rogue:

Rogue is a class that is the embodiment of teemo. You are the epitome of flexibility in the battlefield. A phantom that eliminates targets without a whisper of a trace, a master of toxincraft that employs venoms(there is a fucking difference) to wipe out swathes of filthy peasants, or the terror that obliterates supply lines. The rogue is the controller of the battlefield, a master of strategy and maneuverability.

  
  

Enabler:

Enablers are crucial members to the party that exist to support the party and enable plays. While composed of healers, tanks, buffers, the enablers serve a far more important role. Whether that is scouting, teleporting, planning, terrain shaping, or any other myriad role, every party should strive to have one. Additionally, all classes may take on a specialty enabler role composed of crafters, scavengers, miners, blacksmiths, engineers, architects, chefs, haulers, and many other types.

  
  

Warrior:

The warrior is the bread and butter of the front line. Whether the fierce berserker who wreaks havoc and strikes fear in the hearts of cowards, the powerful duelist who isolates and corners their foes, or the classic shield and sword guardian that employs powerful skills to crush swathes of enemies, the warrior is the ideal pick for those who wish to be deeply intertwined within the nitty gritty melee.

  
  

Class specifications

  
  

Mages:

Mostly handing this to you noot,

Uses casting(and consequently casting minigames) to cast a variety of spells. Reliant on the range and shape of the mage domain(maybe). The mages have to memorize the spells themselves, like literally memorize the incantation -unless it’s a cantrip, which may or may not exist.

  

Archer:

Sharpshooters can enter a flow state where they play osu to fucking hit critical long shots. Can “dodge” with movement keys but moves the cursor a considerable amount as well.(might want to consider adding a separate minigame type of thing for people who want to play sharpshooter but can’t play rhythm for the life of them.)

  
  
  
  

Focus on classes and teamwork.

Emphasis on guild work and party work. Solo grinding should be possible but ideally, you are focused on party grinding.

  

Combat is the primary focus but not the sole focus.
