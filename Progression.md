Progression is "stat" based. Fundamentally, everything is a numbers game. Ideally, we balance it so that there's no objective best build.

What role do levels play?

there are 90 levels. Each group of thirty provides a skill point. Each group of thirty is seperated into class->subclass-> specialization. Each level up will also provide stat points. leveling up should be treated as a combination of 2 things being "more like" an archetype(similar to how beyonder sequences work), and mastering your nature more vis experience.

To unlock the specialty ultimate, you need a 91st skill point, which is unlocked from a questwhere you have to defeat a gauntlet. 90 versions of you face you in one in one combat, where each version's ai progressively gets harder. I did say one in one but the type of combat changes depending on stuff like subclass and specialty. Once you finish them all, you earn the last level up. test?
