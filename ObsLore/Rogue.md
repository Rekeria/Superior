The Rogue class is filled with many different types, each with a central focus on absurd amounts of movement.

The 3 subclasses are Assassin, Battle dancer, and .

Assassin:
Assassin is a class that embodies the idea of terrorizing the enemy. Utilizing quick in-out attacks, they launch assaults when they are least expected and deal critical damage.
The specializations, while still changing how they deal damage, are primarily focused on finding ways to disorient enemies and launch unexpected attacks.
They have access to "criticals" which are their skill check.
They are: Trickster, Phantom, Alchemist.

Tricksters use smokes, clones, and misdirection to hit their critical. They use their clones as movement and their smokes as cover. 
Phantoms utilize blinking and invisibility to strike their misdirection. enemies bleedout before they understand why.
Alchemists use potions and poisons to apply heavy stacking debuffs that can be triggered for a reaction. Gameplay is focused on applying correct combinations of potions. during combos. 

Battle dancer:
battle dancers are terrors on the battle field, using powerful aoe skills and quick grapples to subdue enemies and zip from point to point. The tradeoff? Cooldowns. A battle dancer without cooldowns is nothing more than a sitting duck.

The specialities are: (3 phs, idk what to call them.)


(name for fantasy race. Think goblins, I'll use ph for now. I might also make these just regular people that are like genius engineers or smth).
ph's are yordle-ish goblin thingys. They use ph-tech to kit their small bodies, enabling them to leap around and cause as much mischief as they can.
There are 3 subclasses: pyromaniac, 

pyromaniacs throw oiled cables, entrapping enemies or pulling allies. These can ignite, cauterizing wounds or burning enemies. Think ziggs x rumble.



Gameplay:
Assassins play off their "criticals" which can also be "sneak attacks". Dealing a frankly ridiculous amount of damage. Once they land a sneak attack, they have to deal as much damage in a sequence as possible, this can be accomplished by "mashing" buttons for abilities. In these combos, they have no cds but are instead balanced by their energy, which decreases with each ability. There, they get to choose between more damage output, by combining damage moves, or higher total damage, in maintaining the combo with energy regaining abilities. To land a sneak attack, the assassin must hit a weak spot on the enemy(visor, joints, back, etc) and beat them in a contest of combos. They have to perform one of 10 randomly generated combos faster than their opponent. They also have to be cautious, if they run out of energy, they will not be able to escape.

battle dancers focus on being a menace *everywhere*. They quickly zip from point a to point b and do a crud ton of damage. While they certainly can't do too much altogether dps, they excel at hunting swarms and large monsters. 
The whip one is very similar to levi ackerman, using cables as both transport and weaponry. They extend cables to whip across the team. It is very reactionary. Gameplay wise, it focuses on binding, cutting, wire takedowns, and sweeping throws.
the Kunai one focuses more on quick preplanning, They dash from target to target, throwing kunai. The kunai can be retracted for extra damage. The paths are more long range and allow for more high dps in a smaller area. The twist? They can't dynamically change their plan, they have to lay out the kunai from a distance first or else they lose momentum, and thus damage. They are primarily focused on single target burst, quick mobility, and quick planning. 
The fist one(weird for a class called battle dancer, ik) focuses on exerting powerful sweeping aoe energy attacks. Using slow but highly mobile kicks, punches, and grapples, the fist one leaps from enemy to enemy, overpowering them one at a time. They have to be precise with timing and aim to make sure they land exactly where and when they want.
