Mage has 3 subclasses, elementalist, spiritualist, and arcanist.


Elementalist:
the elementalist is a master of the laws of nature. Using the 4 primal forms of existence, they combine an endless array of elemental powers to defeat their foes. 
They have 4 specializations: Druid, Combustor, Stormcaller, and the Terracaster

Druids have a primary focus on nature, casting spells to grow and manipulate terrain. They use flora to fight. The perfect flexible mage to handle swarms and entangle foes.
Combustors are mages who focus on creating high energy explosions of fire. While not strong against singular targets, Combustors excel at deleting crowds.
Stormcallers are elementalists with a specialty in water, lightning, and wind. 
Terracasters are grounded mages who use their earth magic to form offensive and defensive constructs, launching the fury of the earth itself towards their foes.


Spiritualist:
The spiritualist is the summoner generalization. They call upon other beings, whether via contract, domination, or bond. They are primarily focused on buffing their summons and managing them to swarm and overpower enemies.
They have 3 specializations: Sprite master, Contractor, necromancer(hidden)

Sprite masters are humans who have settled a balance between their spiritual selves and their physical. Sprite masters have a contract with an elder sprite. Using a portable medium, the commanded sprites can take multiple forms to fulfill whatever niche is needed most.
Contractors are humans who have forsook the mortal plane and signed a contract with a higher power. Reaching from the outer planes, Contractors summon a myriad of hellish abominations to assist them in their non-mortal endeavors.
Necromancers are a hidden class that harnesses the souls of the fallen to raise hordes that overwhelm opponents. Among those, different ranks of undead exist which can help control the army.


Arcanist:
The arcanist is a master who has learned to abuse the world's laws. Arcanists employ loopholes to perform miraculous deeds.
They have 3 specializations: magic engineer, Chronomancer, and Spatial Warpist.

The magic engineer is a studied scholar that has perfected the art of designing tools. Capable of magically forming battlefield augments for temporary boosts, raising defensive structures, or entering battle in a mechanum suit of their own designing, magic engineers push intricate mana engineering to an extreme.
The Chronomancer is an expert mage who has learned how to cheat time. Capable of reaching into the future to bring effects into reality(reducing cooldowns, or giving a temporary charge), freezing dangers, or skipping past the harmful effects of negative statuses, the chronomancer, while limited in ability, is extraordinarily versatile.
The spatial warpist thrives alone or with a party. Capable of opening portals to swiftly transport flanks, supply an army, or create gravitational wells to decimate foes.


Gameplay:

Spell casting will be dependent on the primary specialization but will have a variety of different forms.
All mages cast spells with incantations, the depth of which varies.
Elementalists will have to not only memorize their incantations but combine their spells for more powerful effects, this can be done by attaching either a completed stored spell to a new spell, or by typing it out in one long string.

Spiritualists will have most of their skill checks come in the actual management of their summons. Summon hp and number is limited. It will be rts styled. Ofc, to summon their own troops, they need an incantation. This incantation however will be far shorter and dependent on keybinds, causing the specific type of unit to be produced from their own production grounds(whether that be the slow moving sprite hearth or the immobile spawning circles).

Arcanists will have unique games for the 3 classes. ME's must connect the components in an effective pattern. The pattern will be measured on a scale from 0% - 300%. Obv, easier puzzles will be capped at lower values. It will be absurdly hard to get over 200%. In return, a giant ass beam of light will illuminate higher tier operations. Multiple ME's can work on the same thing at the same time.
Chronomancers will have to balance a tempo resource and work with extremely restricted laws(it's not just warudo spam). While they do have to use incantations, they also can skip their incantations with time magic itself. Chronomancers are limited in mobility by the idea of *relativity*. Everything a chronomancer does is relative to themselves. If they move, the zones they place move as well, the positive effects they place are shortened, and negative effects they reduce are relengthened. Frozen time progresses with movement.
Spatial warpists have to balance the gravitational flow of the battlefield. When placing a portal, they have to be aware of how it will affect the things around them at high levels of play. At low levels, it follows the simple rule "output cannot be near output". Should they fail, devastating gravity wells will ravage the battlefield. Key to their operation is that spatial warpists themselves cannot enter operational portals themselves because they are the conduit for their magic.
